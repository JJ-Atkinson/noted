todo:

 - Create and validate `-min` builds.
 - Package the app.
 - Add pinned notes feature.
 - [+] Add tools to enable note to be inserted into another.
   - Optionally, maybe just bake a collector note. 
 - [+] Convert the note storage mechanism to use :id internally.
 - Research the incorporation of finite state machines or behavior trees.
 - Trim nicely the preview in search view & render the MD.
 - [+] Save the notes.
 - Add arrow key functionality to search view.
